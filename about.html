        I have degree in Information Systems and a postgraduate degree in Project Management. Started my career very early in 2014 as a Developer in a small company.

      <p class="principal__apresentacao">
        As I have a researcher profile, always tried to improve myself with lots of differents technologies and also apply what I studied at graduation. In this way, I had to look for bigger companies that could offer me this environment.
      </p>
      <p class="principal__apresentacao">
        Since then I have been responsible for many important projects in which I have acted. I'm currently 29 years old and I still haven't stopped improving myself intellectually, I'm planning a new postgraduate or graduation very soon.
